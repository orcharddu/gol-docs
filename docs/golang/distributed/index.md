# Distributed Implementation

In this stage, you are required to create an implementation that uses a number of
AWS nodes to cooperatively calculate the new state of the Game of Life board,
and communicate state between machines over a network.

Below is a series of suggested steps for approaching the problem, but you are *not* required to
follow this sequence, and can jump straight to implementing the more advanced
versions of the system if you feel confident about it.

Your implementation will be marked against the success criteria outlined [here](success-criteria).
