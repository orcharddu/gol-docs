# UoB CSA Coursework: Game of Life

This is the summative coursework for University of Bristol Computer Systems A unit,
it is worth 80% of the unit mark.

It is to be completed in your programming pairs.
You must report any change to your pairing to the unit director *before* starting your coursework.

It runs over 4 weeks.

::: warning Note on deadline
The deadline for submitting all your work is **TBD**
:::

Talk to each other regularly and make sure you manage your team well.
Let us know about issues before they grow to affect your teamâ€™s performance.

It is important to carefully manage your time for this assignment.
Do not spend hours trying to debug on your own; use pair programming, seek help from our teaching assistants during scheduled labs and ask questions on Teams.

**Do not plagiarise.** Both team members should understand all code developed in detail.

Do not have one team member do just the parallel task and the other do just the distributed task. There is significant overlap between the two. If you work separately then both team members will have to solve the same problems separately.

Similarly, do not have one team member do the programming tasks and the other just write the report. You need an in-depth understanding of the code to write a good report.
