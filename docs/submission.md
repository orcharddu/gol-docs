# Submission

::: tip Note on submission

The coursework requires two independent implementations - parallel and distributed.

You will be required to submit **both** implementations (assuming both were attempted).

Every student is required to upload their full work to Blackboard.

There will be three separate submissions points on Blackboard - one for the report and two for each implementation.

- For the report, you must submit a single file called `report.pdf`, strictly max 6 pages.

  **Report submission point will appear here later.**

- For the parallel implementation, you must submit a single zip file called `parallel.zip`. It must contain all the code required to compile and run the program. Submit a complete copy of the skeleton, **not just the `gol` folder**.

  **Parallel submission point will appear here later.**

- For the distributed implementation, you must submit a single zip file called `distributed.zip`. It must contain all the code required to compile and run the program.

  **Distributed submission point will appear here later.**

- If you have multiple versions, only submit the ones you wish us to check for correctness (one zip for parallel and one for distributed). Other versions may be shared via OneDrive with Sion, Michael and Jed.

::: warning Please notice

- Submitting different filenames or file formats (e.g. `.docx`, `.tex`, `.7z` or `.rar`) will result in a mark penalty.
- **Each team member** has to upload an **identical copy** of the team's work.
- Make sure you submit it early (not last minute!) to avoid upload problems.
- Make sure your team memberâ€™s names and user names appear on page 1 of the report.\
**Do not include a cover page. Strictly max 6 pages.**

You should be using `Git` for version control, however, please don't include your `.git` directory in your submission.

You can generate a correct archive by typing `git archive -o [FILENAME].zip HEAD`.
